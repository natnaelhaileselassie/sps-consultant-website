# sps-consultant-website
Website for a retired Senior Procurement Specialist Consultant

# Project Overview
This is a project documenting my process to build a personal portfolio website for a retired Senior Procurement Specialist. The project uses kanban boards to implement an agile development methodology lightly inspired by scrum. I chose not to use full scrum as I am working on this solo and am prioritizing a working product over comprehensive documentation.
